# JACK for Ubuntu 20
This is the free version of JACK for Linux, sourced from the HLFX.ru website (meaning this is NOT the Steam version). It has been updated to work on Ubuntu 20+ and other distros that don't have its required packages installed by default.

## How to run
1. Open the Terminal.
2. `cd` to this repository folder (assuming that you either cloned it or downloaded the ZIP and extracted it to a folder of your choice)
3. Type `bash install.sh` into the terminal.
4. Wait for the process to finish. Then, type `bash bin/Jack.sh` into the Terminal and JACK should open.
